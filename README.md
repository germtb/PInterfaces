PInterfaces
===========

Programatically created interfaces

This project is an attempt to simplify the process of creating interfaces programatically. 
There are many reasons for using interface builder, but also some for creating your 
interfaces purely with code (dynamical interfaces, repetitivenss). Personally never use 
interface builder so I have faced quite a lot of problems, for which I have acquired 
some solutions. I would be glad if any of these are suiteable for any others.
